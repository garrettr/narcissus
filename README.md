Experiment to verify downloads from Tor mirrors

setup
=====

1. Clone the repo
2. Install [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) (if you don't already have them)
3. cd into the repo and `vagrant up`

This creates a vm that has a shared folder with the repo contents in /vagrant.

You can ssh into it with `vagrant ssh`.
